My project involves creating a validation form in JavaScript to ensure data entered by users is accurate and meets specified criteria. Throughout this project, I've learned new techniques for form validation, such as using regular expressions and implementing custom error messages. This experience has deepened my understanding of JavaScript programming and enhanced my ability to create user-friendly web applications.
