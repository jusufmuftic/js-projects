Through this project, I learned how to make cookies that you see everyday. For those who don't know, cookies are small pieces of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. They help that website remember information about your visit, which can both make it easier to visit the site again and make the site more useful to you. Here I represent a small cookie that saves information and keep your user info, so you dont have to login everytime you visit the website.
