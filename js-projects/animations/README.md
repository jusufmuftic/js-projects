In this project, I learned how to create some captivating animations using JavaScript. Through learning and practice, I learned some various animation techniques, including text animation, line animation, and image animation. With each technique, I honed my skills in manipulating HTML elements and CSS properties dynamically through JavaScript. This project not only expanded my knowledge of front-end development but also provided me with a creative outlet to express my ideas through motion on the web.
