In this project, I delved into the fascinating world of the Document Object Model (DOM) through a personal project. The DOM, as a crucial aspect of web development, became my focal point, guiding me through the intricacies of manipulating HTML and CSS elements dynamically. This hands-on experience not only deepened my understanding of JavaScript but also empowered me to create more interactive and responsive web applications.
